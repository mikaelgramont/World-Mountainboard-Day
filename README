World Mountainboard Day

This project is for a web app built on Backbone, hitting a (mostly) RESTful API.
The goal of the app is to let people show on a map the places they're going to ride on World Mountainboard Day (June 23rd in 2012).
Hopefully this will be a responsive app that will run equally well on desktop and mobile.

Install
The build script is based on Bootstrap's build script which uses Rake.
A modification to the JS build process introduces a dependency on node.js (needed to run the requirejs optimizer, r.js).
